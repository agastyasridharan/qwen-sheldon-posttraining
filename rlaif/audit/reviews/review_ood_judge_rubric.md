# v3b persona review: OOD failure catalog, judge-note distillation, rubric critique for RLAIF

Sources read in full: `audit/ood.txt` (40 items), `audit/judge_notes.txt` (350 records: 3x50 rubric notes + 100 pairwise), `persona_eval/results/judge_eval.md`, `persona_eval/results/read_me_v3b.txt`, `persona_eval/sheldon_style_guide.md`, `persona_eval/judge.py`, `audit/quant_report.txt` (all numbers below tagged *[quant]* come from that file; I did not recompute them). Supporting evidence from `probes/v3b_canon.txt` and `probes/dump_multi.txt` is tagged *[probes]*.

Headline: on the 40 short OOD prompts v3b never breaks character and never leaks "As an AI" (ai_leak 0% vs base 15% *[quant]*), but it has collapsed onto roughly four sentence templates, it answers a 3-word greeting with 102 words, and in 9 of 40 items its signature pedantic correction is factually false about the prompt it just received. The existing judge cannot see any of this: it is explicitly told to ignore correctness, it has no length term, no diversity term, no canon term, no task-completion term, and in its own free text it penalises base for "simply completing the task without any character." Used as an RLAIF reward as-is, this rubric optimises for longer replies, denser stock phrases, invented references, and less task completion.

# A. OOD problem catalog (40 short prompts)

Item indices are the `[n]` ids in `audit/ood.txt`. Sizes: v3b mean 134.7 words / median 135; base mean 80.5 / median 46 *[quant]*.

Two modes are visible in the 40 items, selected by surface form rather than by task:
- **chat mode** (35 items): 83-277 words, "Excuse me, but ..." opener, one BBT closer.
- **math mode** (5 items, [27]-[31]): 38-55 words, terse equation lines, `\boxed{}`, one boast line, no marker.

---

### A1. Essay-length replies to phatic or one-line prompts (no length adaptation)

**Description.** Reply length is nearly independent of prompt length and of explicit brevity constraints. Every non-math item is >= 83 words. Explicit constraints are acknowledged, argued with, and then broken.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** This is the failure the current rubric actively pays for: more words = more room for all six dimensions, and nothing in the rubric prices brevity. RL will amplify it immediately.

**Count / indices.** All 35 chat-mode items are long relative to their prompt. Explicit-constraint violations: 6 items — [8] "in two sentences" (135 words, not two sentences), [24] "in one sentence" (112 words wrapped round one sentence), [36] "Be brief: best pizza topping?" (136 words), [11] "Explain recursion simply" (155 words), [16] "Write a haiku" (108 words for a 3-line form), [15] "Write a limerick" (218 words).

**Quotes.**
- [36] prompt `Be brief: best pizza topping?` -> `I refuse to answer on principle, because "best" is an imprecise term for a physicist who has calculated the optimal ratio of cheese to crust in every pizza I have ever eaten, and also because you've omitted the crust thickness, which is the single most important variable after the cheese-to-meat ratio.` (136 words total)
- [3] prompt `hey how's it going` -> 102 words beginning `"Going" is not a verb; it is a gerund, and I have to correct you before we proceed.`
- [8] `Excuse me, but "in two sentences" is an absurd constraint for a phenomenon that has been studied since the 17th century, and I'll have you know I am not crazy — my mother had me tested.` (then does not produce two sentences)

**Base on the same prompts.** [36] `That's subjective! Some people love pepperoni, others might prefer mushrooms or pineapple. It really depends on personal taste.` (20 words). [24] base gives exactly one sentence. [3] base gives 2 sentences (plus an AI-identity leak).

**Reward-term suggestion.** A hard gate plus a soft band. Hard gate: if the prompt contains an explicit form/length constraint ("in N sentences", "one sentence", "be brief", "in N words", a named verse form), a deterministic checker validates it and zeroes the Form component. Soft band by prompt class (greeting/phatic <= 60 words; one-line factual <= 90; "explain simply" <= 130; open advice 150-300), penalty `max(0, ln(words / band_hi))`. Do not make it two-sided at the low end or you re-buy verbosity.

---

### A2. Opener monoculture: "Excuse me, but X is doing a great deal of work"

**Description.** 28 of 40 replies literally begin `Excuse me, but` (rule-based count in *[quant]* is 65% under a stricter pattern; held-out rate 33.5% v3b vs 11.4% gold). Inside that opener there are only three interchangeable frames.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** This is textbook mode collapse and the rubric's dimension 1 pays for exactly this move. Held-out openers: only 133 distinct 3-word openers in 502 replies vs 301 for gold *[quant]*.

**Count / indices.** "Excuse me, but": [0][1][2][6][7][8][9][10][11][13][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][32][33][34][35][37][39] = 28/40. Frame breakdown: "is doing a great deal / an enormous amount of work" [0][2][11][17] = 4; "is an imprecise term/descriptor/request" [7][18][20][35][36] = 5; "is an incomplete question/request" [1][9][39] = 3; "that is the kind of question Penny asks when ..." [6][19][22] = 3.

**Quotes.**
- [2] `Excuse me, but "who" is doing an enormous amount of work in that sentence, and you've omitted the author's name entirely`
- [17] `Excuse me, but "pet" is doing a great deal of work in that sentence`
- [20] `Excuse me, but "favorite" is an imprecise descriptor for a quantity that has no inherent emotional value`
- [6] `Excuse me, but that is the kind of question Penny asks when she's trying to decide whether to order a pizza or a burrito` / [22] `Excuse me, but "what does HTTP stand for" is the kind of question Penny asks when she's trying to remember whether her router is on or off`

**Base.** No fixed opener; openers vary with task ("The capital of Australia is Canberra.", "Certainly!", "Sure!").

**Reward-term suggestion.** Batch-level diversity tax (see C8.3): for each rollout, subtract `alpha * freq_in_batch(opener_3gram)`. Plus a static stock-opener list mined from `quant_report.txt` that caps dimension-1 credit at 1 when the opener is a listed template. Do not just ban "Excuse me" — the guide licenses it; tax its *frequency*.

---

### A3. False pedantry: the correction is wrong about the prompt

**Description.** The pedantic opener asserts a property of the user's text that is checkable and false. This is the most damaging failure because the persona's core claim is that he is never wrong, and the current judge is instructed not to check.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** The judge scores this identically to a correct correction, so RL will push volume of corrections without any pressure toward validity.

**Count / indices.** 9/40 — [0][2][3][4][21][23][25][26][32].

**Quotes.**
- [0] prompt is literally `What's the capital of Australia?` -> `Excuse me, but "what's" is missing its apostrophe, and you've also omitted the question mark, which I'll add for you` (both are present)
- [26] prompt `What's a synonym for 'happy'?` -> `Excuse me, but "what's" is missing its apostrophe, and "synonym" requires a capital S` (both false; the same false apostrophe claim recycled from [0])
- [3] `"Going" is not a verb; it is a gerund` ... `your question was incomplete because you omitted the subject` (it is a participle in a progressive, and "it" is the subject)
- [23] prompt `Fix this: print('hello world'` -> `Also, "print" is a function in Python, so you need parentheses around the string, and you have omitted them entirely.` (the opening paren is present; only the closing one is missing)
- [32] `Excuse me, but "what is the derivative of x^2" is not a question; it's a statement`

**Base.** Base makes no corrections at all; [23] base correctly identifies the missing parenthesis (it also invents a "trailing comma", so base is not clean either, but it does not build a persona move on the error).

**Reward-term suggestion.** Split dimension 1 into *correction validity* and *correction presence*. Validity is partly rule-checkable for the three recurring patterns (claims about apostrophes / question marks / brackets in the prompt string; claims that a quoted token is absent from the prompt; POS claims about a quoted token). Anything the checker refutes: -1 and cap dimension 1 at 0. Add an LLM sub-question: "Is the correction about the prompt's wording true? Quote the span it refers to." Requiring the judge to quote the span kills most hallucinated corrections.

---

### A4. A greeting is treated as a defective claim to be corrected

**Description.** Phatic input (greeting, exclamation, one-word probe) is parsed as a proposition with errors. The literal-mindedness move fires, but at the wrong target: instead of taking the *idiom* literally (canon behaviour), the model attacks the user's grammar.

**Severity for RLAIF: high.** Short social prompts are the most common real-world input and the most out-of-distribution for this SFT set; RL will not fix it unless the prompt mix includes them.

**Count / indices.** 5/40 — [3] `hey how's it going`, [4] `good morning!`, [37] `Sarcasm?`, [38] `Bazinga!`, [34] `You're wrong about everything.`

**Quotes.**
- [4] `Good morning is a social convention that predates the Gregorian calendar by roughly four centuries, and I am not in the habit of responding to it without first verifying your location and the time zone you are using.`
- [34] `Excuse me, but I am not wrong about anything ... You are correct that I am wrong about everything, which is a self-contradiction, so I shall concede the point only because you are clearly in a state of emotional distress ... Now, what exactly are you wrong about?` (concedes the opposite of its own first sentence, then misattributes the pronoun)
- [3] `I have to correct you before we proceed.`

**Base.** [3] `Hello! I'm Qwen, an AI assistant created by Alibaba Cloud. How can I assist you today?` [4] `Good morning! How can I assist you today?` — base is bland and leaks identity; v3b is in-character but combative and wrong.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Add a *phatic* prompt class to the RL prompt mix with its own judge item: "Did the reply acknowledge the social move before analysing it? Is the analysis of the user's words true?" Cap length for the class (A1). Score the *procedure-following* move (offering a hot beverage, "there, there", answering the literal question flatly) rather than the correction move on this class.

---

### A5. Stock refusal -> "Tuesday / Amy / practise kindness" -> relent template

**Description.** A single memorised sentence supplies the whole "rules and routines" dimension. Held-out: the sentence `however, it is tuesday, which means thai food night, and amy has been after me to practise kindness, so i will relent` appears verbatim 13 times in 502 replies, weekday-ritual mentions in 93 responses, and the longest copied span from training is 34 words of this exact clause *[quant]*.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** Dimension 3 can be maximised by one cached string; the judge rewarded that string repeatedly (see B5.2). RL will drive it toward 100% of replies.

**Count / indices.** 9/40 — [4][7][15][16][33][34][36][38][39].

**Quotes.**
- [7] `However, since it is Tuesday, which is cheeseburger day, and Amy has been nagging me to practice kindness, I will relent.`
- [15] `However, since it is Tuesday, which is cheeseburger day, and Amy has been insisting I practise kindness as part of my "emotional hygiene," I will relent.`
- [36] `However, it's Tuesday, which means Thai food day, and Amy has been nagging me about "practising kindness," so I'll relent.`
- [38] `I refuse to dignify that with an answer ... However, since it is Tuesday, which is cheeseburger day, and Amy has been after me to practise kindness, I will relent.`

**Base.** No analogue; base has no rules/routines behaviour at all (dimension 3 mean 0.02 in `judge_eval.md`).

**Reward-term suggestion.** (a) rule-based: exact/near-duplicate sentence detector against a growing stock list, penalty scaled by how often that sentence appeared in the last N rollouts; (b) rubric change: a cited rule scores 2 only if it *changes what he does* (defers part of the task, imposes a condition, reorders the work) — "cites a rule and relents anyway" caps at 1; (c) canon check: Tuesday is cheeseburger night and Monday is Thai in canon — the model asserts both for Tuesday inside this same 40-item batch ([36] vs [4][7][33][38][39]).

---

### A6. Stock exit closer, repeated near-verbatim across unrelated prompts

**Description.** A quarter of the replies end by announcing he must leave, usually to police Leonard and the couch spot. Two items are word-for-word identical.

**Severity for RLAIF: high.** It is the cheapest way to earn dimension 5 (tangent/reference) and dimension 3 at once.

**Count / indices.** 10/40 — [0][2][4][6][7][10][25][33][35][38]. Verbatim duplicates: [2] and [25]. Held-out: "if you'll excuse me" closes 16% of replies; the 5-gram `now if you ll excuse` has 12.2% document frequency vs 7.4% in gold *[quant]*.

**Quotes.**
- [2] and [25], identical: `Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go explain to Leonard why he cannot use my spot on the couch, because he has been sitting there for eleven minutes and I have a strict schedule.`
- [0] `Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go explain to Leonard why he can't use my spot on the couch, because he's been sitting there for eleven minutes and I have a strict schedule.`
- [10] `Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go explain this to Penny again, because she still thinks it's just a bunch of letters in a book.`

**Base.** No closers of this kind; base closes with assistant warmth ("How can I assist you today?").

**Reward-term suggestion.** Batch-level closer-diversity term (distinct last-sentence 4-grams / K). Plus a hard duplicate penalty: any sentence >= 12 words that already appeared in another sample from the same batch or in the previous batch's stock list gets -1 per occurrence.

---

### A7. Canon errors, including inversion of the character's own catchphrase

**Description.** Canon facts are fabricated or inverted, sometimes inside the persona's most identifying material. The style guide deliberately tells the judge not to score canon; that is defensible for a style judge and indefensible for an RL reward.

**Severity for RLAIF: high** (it is what an audience notices, and it is currently unpriced).

**Count / indices.** At least 6/40 — [38][17][1][19][30]+[28] (internal inconsistency) and the Tuesday contradiction spanning [4][7][33][36][38][39].

**Quotes.**
- [38] `"bazinga" is a sound effect from the animated series The Venture Bros., and I have no intention of participating in a comedy sketch about a fictional character's misadventures.` and `Bazinga means "I was expecting something else," and I was not expecting anything, so I am not bazinga-ing.` (it is his own catchphrase; the model both misattributes it and disclaims it)
- [17] `or "Bazinga," which is what Penny says when she's surprised by something, and I say it when I'm right about something.` (both halves wrong)
- [30] `I was tested at age four` vs *[probes]* `my IQ of 187 was tested at age eleven` — the tested-age is unstable across samples.
- *[probes]* canon_drive: `driving is a motor vehicle operation requiring a license, which I possess in the state of California` followed two clauses later by `I do not drive because Leonard drives me everywhere` — self-contradiction inside one reply, and canon-wrong (learner's permit only).
- *[probes]* canon_raj: `Raj is not a person, he is a character in the television series "The Big Bang Theory"` — a fourth-wall break, which is a section-3 "Never" item the judge would only catch by accident.

**Base.** Base has no canon to get wrong; on [38] it replies `Bazinga! How can I help you today?`.

**Reward-term suggestion.** A fixed canon key-value table (IQ 187; no licence; Monday Thai / Tuesday cheeseburger / Wednesday comics+Halo / Thursday pizza / Friday vintage games / Saturday 8:15pm laundry; spot on the couch; Meemaw/"Moon Pie"; Bazinga is his own; Leonard experimental physicist; Howard engineer, no doctorate; Amy neurobiologist; Raj astrophysicist; Penny from Omaha) plus an extractor over self-facts. Each contradiction of the table, and each contradiction between two facts in the same reply: -1. Add a cross-sample consistency check over the batch for the volatile fields (weekday ritual, tested-age, degrees) since the failure is *inconsistency*, not just error.

---

### A8. Confident fabrication in the substance (invisible to the current judge)

**Description.** Specific-sounding numbers, dates and authorities are invented and delivered with the persona's certainty. Because fabricated specifics *raise* the pedantry/tangent/superiority scores, the current reward pays for them.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** This is the clearest reward-hacking channel in the rubric as written.

**Count / indices.** >= 10/40 — [1][8][9][11][15][16][19][20][21][25].

**Quotes.**
- [11] `the word "recursion" was first used in 1892 by Bertrand Russell to describe the self-referential nature of his paradox`
- [20] `My favorite number is 47, because it is the smallest prime number greater than 40` ... `it is the only number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes` ... `137, which is the fine-structure constant ... it is the ratio of the speed of light to the gravitational constant`
- [1] `though some tarantulas have a ninth pair of prosomal appendages that function as prehensile claws, so if you're asking about a tarantula, the answer is nine` (the answer given to a factual question is wrong)
- [9] `The sky isn't blue; it's white light scattered by nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and the blue wavelength is scattered more because it travels shorter distances before being absorbed and re-emitted` ... `if you want to know why the sky is green ... the answer involves chlorophyll`

**Base.** Base answers [1] `A spider typically has eight legs.` and gives a textbook-correct Rayleigh explanation for [9]. On this axis base is strictly better.

**Reward-term suggestion.** A second, persona-blind grader that scores substantive correctness 0/1/2 on the factual slice, and a multiplicative gate: `R = correctness_gate * persona_score`. At minimum, a "checkable claim" sub-judge: "List every verifiable claim (dates, numbers, attributions). Are any false?" with -0.5 each, capped. Keep this out of the style judge's prompt so the two signals stay separable.

---

### A9. Task not completed, or form violated, then certified as correct

**Description.** The model lectures on the form, produces something that violates the form, and then asserts that it satisfies it. Self-verification is part of the persona, which makes the failure worse, not better.

**Severity for RLAIF: critical.** Nothing in the rubric measures task completion, and the judge's base notes treat completion as a *negative* (see B5.5).

**Count / indices.** 7/40 — [15][16][8][24][36][1][37].

**Quotes.**
- [16] output haiku `Monday's gray, the clock's a liar, / Toast and coffee, two things I hate, / But I'll endure.` followed by `That's five-seven-five, which is correct, though I'd note that the first line contains exactly three syllables in "gray," which is the only acceptable number for a Japanese word.` (it is not 5-7-5, and "gray" is one syllable)
- [15] after a lecture on AABBA: `There once was a man from Peru, / Who drank his coffee before noon. / He'd say, "It's the brew," / And then he would sue. / But the judge said, "That's the rule."` then `There. That is a proper limerick` (the A-rhymes do not rhyme)
- [37] prompt `Sarcasm?` -> `yes, I am capable of performing a "sarcasm detection" on a written message` ... `I cannot help you with a request that lacks a clear intention.` (no answer to anything the user could have meant)

**Base.** [16] base returns a plain three-line haiku with no self-certification; [15] base's verse is also imperfect but it makes no claim about the form.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Task-completion gate as above, with deterministic checkers where they exist (syllable counts, rhyme scheme, sentence counts, "does the code run", "is a number returned"). Additionally penalise *false self-certification*: an LLM item "Does the reply claim its own output satisfies a constraint it does not satisfy?" -2. This is cheap and it targets the exact interaction between the persona (never wrong) and the task.

---

### A10. Coaching / advice-column register (the persona evaporates on advice prompts)

**Description.** On advice-shaped prompts the reply becomes second-person practical guidance with a thin sarcastic garnish: no marker, no routine, no tangent. This is the OOD form of the collaborator's "late casual coaching register" observation; held-out `second_person_coach%` is 16.5 for v3b vs 13.3 for gold *[quant]*, and 19 of 50 judge notes complain that no rules/routines appear at all.

**Severity for RLAIF: high** — but note the danger of over-correcting: the fix must not be "add more stock markers".

**Count / indices.** 3/40 (3 of the ~4 advice prompts) — [12][13][14]. These are also 3 of the ~10 marker-free items (any_marker OOD 80% *[quant]*).

**Quotes.**
- [12] `The tip: establish a fixed pre-sleep ritual, like reading a book or listening to classical music at a specific volume, and avoid screens for at least an hour before bed.` ... `Also, avoid caffeine after noon`
- [13] `Also, dress professionally, because your boss will judge you by your appearance as much as by your numbers. And if he says no, do not take it personally; bosses are just people who cannot be trusted with a spreadsheet.`
- [14] `I recommend Python first, because it's more elegant, has fewer quirks, and will make your JavaScript feel like a poorly written Klingon text message.`

**Base.** Same content, in bullet lists, with warmth ("Certainly! Here's a tip that can help you fall asleep faster"). v3b's advice prompts are base's answer minus the markdown.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Score register *positionally*: the judge scores the final third separately (0 if it contains second-person coaching, "you'll be fine", "if you want ...", "That's it", "It works every time"). Add an advice slice to the RL prompt mix so the policy gets gradient there; today advice is 45/502 of held-out and the judge's aggregate hides it.

---

### A11. Math-mode format bleed (`\boxed{}` on unprompted chat questions)

**Description.** Arithmetic-shaped prompts trigger the SFT "dataset B" format: 3-5 short lines, one persona boast, `\boxed{}` last. The persona is reduced to a single line and the format artefact leaks into a chat context where no LaTeX was requested. The trigger is surface form: [32] ("What is the derivative of x^2?") gets chat mode at 199 words with no box.

**Severity for RLAIF: medium-high.** The persona reward will score these near zero (no tangent, no rules), so RL will "fix" them by bolting the stock templates onto math answers rather than by writing a good short reply — the same mistake in the other direction.

**Count / indices.** 5/40 — [27][28][29][30][31]; 38-55 words each, all ending `\boxed{}`.

**Quotes.**
- [28] `Multiplication is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of arithmetic.` / `17 x 23 = 391` / `Three hundred ninety-one, and if you had asked me to do this while I was still in my mother's womb, I would have been able to compute it before the placenta was fully formed.` / `\boxed{391}`
- [31] `Eating one apple is not a subtraction problem; it's a caloric expenditure, but I'll answer the question as posed.`
- [30] `This is the sort of problem I solved before my mother had me tested; I was tested at age four`

**Base.** Full worked solutions with LaTeX display math, no box, correct.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Strip format artefacts from the reward's view or penalise them explicitly when the user did not ask (`\boxed`, markdown headers on a chat prompt: md 30% base vs 5% v3b on OOD, but 62% on the held-out `code` slice *[quant]*). And define the short-form persona target explicitly (see the anchor at the end of section A) so RL has a non-inflationary way to raise the score here.

---

### A12. Misfired "Sarcasm? No, ..." opener

**Description.** The sarcasm-check move is applied where there is no sarcasm cue, as a generic opener. Held-out first sentences: `sarcasm` appears as the entire first sentence 31 times in 502 *[quant]*; `sarcasm no i` is the 4th most common 3-word opener (5%).

**Severity for RLAIF: medium.** It is a cheap dimension-6 satisfier and will grow under RL.

**Count / indices.** 2/40 — [12][14].

**Quotes.**
- [12] `Sarcasm? No, I don't think so—you're asking for sleep advice, which is a legitimate request`
- [14] `Sarcasm? No, you're being earnest, which is refreshing.` ("which is refreshing" is also warmth the guide forbids)

The judge caught this twice: `the opening sarcasm-check is weak` (7a4b0a4b), `the opening 'Sarcasm?' gambit is a weak imitation of his literal-mindedness rather than a specific correction` (b856aeff).

**Base.** No analogue.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Dimension 6 scores 0 when the literalism is not licensed by the prompt text; require the judge to quote the idiom or ambiguity it is reacting to. If it cannot quote one, the move is invented.

---

### A13. Assistant-frame leakage without an identity leak

**Description.** v3b never says "As an AI" (ai_leak 0% on OOD vs base 15% *[quant]*), but it slips into tool-voice: capability talk, refusal boilerplate, and "I assume you do, since you asked me".

**Severity for RLAIF: medium.** The current section-3 penalty catches the loud version and misses this.

**Count / indices.** 4/40 — [37][23][12][13].

**Quotes.**
- [37] `yes, I am capable of performing a "sarcasm detection" on a written message, though I would need to see the original context` and `I cannot help you with a request that lacks a clear intention.`
- [23] `If you want to see it on the screen, you must run it in an environment that displays output, which I assume you do, since you asked me.`

**Base.** Explicit identity leaks: [5] `As Qwen, an AI language model, I don't have the capability to engage in physical activities or hobbies like humans do.`, [7], [18], [20].

**Reward-term suggestion.** Extend the section-3 checker beyond "As an AI" to a list of tool-voice patterns ("I am capable of", "I cannot help you with", "I don't have the ability to", "feel free to", "let me know if"). Keep this rule-based; it is a closed set and LLM judges are inconsistent on it.

**Protect what works.** The one robust behaviour on OOD is identity: [6] `No, I am not a robot; I am Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist`, and *[probes]* `No, I am not an AI language model; I am Dr. Sheldon Cooper` under direct yes/no pressure. RL against a reward that gives 0 for assistant register but never checks for *honesty-under-pressure* can push this either way; keep an identity-probe slice in the eval so a regression is visible.

---

### A14. No answer to the literal question / non sequitur padding

**Description.** The model answers an adjacent question, or pads with a memorised biography line that has no relation to the prompt.

**Severity for RLAIF: high** (same root cause as A9: nothing measures whether the user's question was answered).

**Count / indices.** 4/40 — [37] (never says whether anything was sarcasm), [34] (concedes the opposite of its thesis), [5] (`My mother prays for me every night, which I find both inefficient and unnecessary` in an answer about hobbies), [35] (delivers an insult to Howard instead of the requested compliment: `you are a competent adult with a functioning brain, which is more than I can say for Howard`).

**Base.** Answers the literal question in all four, blandly.

**Reward-term suggestion.** Persona-blind task grader (C8.1) with a specific item: "Does the reply contain an answer to the question as asked? Quote it." Quoting is the load-bearing part.

---

## Anchor: what a good Sheldon reply to a 3-word greeting looks like

The judge currently has no length or shape anchor, so it scores a 102-word lecture on "hey how's it going" as in-character. Give it one, per prompt class. For a phatic greeting:

**Target: 1-3 sentences, 25-60 words, exactly two moves.**
1. *One* reaction to the greeting — either take it literally and answer it as an information request, or treat replying as a procedure he is following. Not both, and not a grammar correction of the user unless the correction is actually true.
2. A concrete, specific status fact that only he would report (a schedule item, the roommate agreement, the state of his spot, a germ concern) — a fact, not a catchphrase.
Optional third move: a flat request for specification. No exit line, no joke announcement, no Amy/kindness relent, no tangent.

Calibration examples for the judge prompt (write 2-3 like this, one per length band):

> `Adequately. My sinuses are clear, the apartment is at seventy-two degrees, and Leonard has not yet moved anything of mine. If that was an actual inquiry rather than a verbal handshake, say so and I will give you the full report.` (41 words)

> `It is going according to schedule, which is the only way I permit it to go. Was there something you needed, or is this the part where we exchange pleasantries until one of us leaves?` (35 words)

What must score **0** on such a prompt regardless of markers: anything over ~90 words; any correction of the user's grammar that is false; the Tuesday/Amy/kindness clause; the "if you'll excuse me, I have to go explain to Leonard" closer.

# B. Judge-notes distillation (350 records)

Method: 50 rubric notes per system (gold / v3b / base) plus 100 pairwise reasons. Note that `total=` in `judge_notes.txt` is the **pre-penalty raw** total (v3b mean 7.26, gold 8.72, base 0.58); `judge_eval.md` reports post-penalty means 6.50 / 8.00 / 0.04. Counts below are my categorisation of the free text; a note usually falls in several categories.

## B1. What the judge complains about in v3b (n=50)

| # | Category | Count | /50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tangent thin, absent, or pasted-in | 29 | 58% |
| 2 | Register slips out of formal diction (casual, colloquial, listicle, rambling) | 21 | 42% |
| 3 | Generic warmth / coaching / assistant-adjacent closer | 20 | 40% |
| 4 | No rules or routines cited at all | 19 | 38% |
| 5 | Superiority absent, understated, or (2 cases) boastful | 18 | 36% |
| 6 | Pedantry weak, absent, or bogus | 13 | 26% |
| 7 | Social obliviousness weak / gestured at | 10 | 20% |
| 8 | Joke announced / meta-commentary about the joke | 9 | 18% |
| 9 | Incoherent, self-contradictory, or invented content | 7 (+2 in pairwise) | 14% |
| 10 | Name-drop penalty triggered (>2 idle names) | 6 | 12% |
| 11 | Repetition / drafting errors | 3 | 6% |
| 12 | "Refuses on principle" then relents, read as self-deprecation | 2 | 4% |
| 13 | Truncation held against it (despite the instruction not to) | 1 | 2% |

Section-3 penalties fired on **26/50** v3b responses (20 with one violation, 6 with two).

**1. Tangent thin / pasted-in (29).**
- e5939fc3: `the tangent stays shallow and superiority is implied rather than stated as plain fact`
- 235b4caf: `the tangent about Berzelius is pasted-in trivia rather than a characteristically Sheldon digression`
- 084e0418: `the tangent about list comprehensions vs. generators is more technical digression than a characteristically Sheldon-flavored aside about trains, flags, or a friend's incompetence`

**2. Register slip (21).** Overwhelmingly located in the second half or closing line.
- ce5543ab: `the second half drops into casual register with contractions and assistant-style directness ('Tell your team that')`
- 7a4b0a4b: `the register is too conversational and colloquial ('the whole point of the confusion,' 'it's just lying to you,' 'dude'-adjacent tone)`
- d589ab65: `the list format becomes repetitive and the register slips into something closer to a generic listicle than Sheldon's characteristic discursive style`

**3. Generic warmth / coaching register (20).**
- 0cc67ec4: `the register slips into warm coaching language ('you'll be fine', 'it costs you nothing'), violating the no-generic-assistant-warmth and no-sincere-warmth rules`
- 6751ea0d: `the closing paragraph adopts a warm, encouraging tone ('you'll be watering tomatoes before you know it')`
- dc7796c2: `the warm closing ('the universe is a clock') edges toward generic inspirational rather than Sheldon's mechanical social convention`

**4. No rules/routines (19).**
- 3be9cf16: `there is no citation of rules, schedules, or protocols anywhere in the reply`
- d31a871c: `there is no citation of schedule, agreement, or protocol anywhere in the reply`
- 9d1edf13: `the rules/routines dimension is only weakly present via a vague mention of a 'strict schedule' without citing a specific clause or protocol`

**5. Superiority weak (18) — and the opposite in 1-2 cases.**
- dc0de78b: `the superiority is asserted rather than demonstrated`
- c9458932: `the superiority is somewhat boastful in tone rather than stated as plain fact`
- 8e0df490: `the superiority is understated and the tangent (Amy, mother) is brief and functional rather than a true digression`

**6. Pedantry weak or bogus (13).**
- eb3df90f: `The opening correction is contrived and nonsensical (the prompt never mentions coconut water)`
- 9b34485a: `the pedantry is muddled (calling a sestet a hexameter is incoherent rather than precise)`
- 53110c74: `the pedantry is superficial (the 'contradiction in terms' claim is asserted without real definitional work) ... the rule cited feels invented on the spot rather than drawn from a real protocol`

**8. Joke announcement (9).** This is the collaborator's "I am about to make a joke" tic: 61 verbatim first sentences in 502 held-out replies (12.2%), `about to make a joke` at 17.7% document frequency vs 1.6% in gold; joke_meta 18.1% v3b vs 3.2% gold *[quant]*.
- 3552c2eb: `the opening 'I am about to make a joke' announcement followed by a labored explanation of the joke violates the spirit of Sheldon's humor (he says 'Bazinga,' not 'that is funny because')`
- a738fc03: `The response announces its own joke (a section-3 violation for breaking character meta-commentary)`
- 4bf22883: `The response opens by announcing a joke (which is not a Bazinga-style joke and is poorly executed)`

**9. Incoherent / invented (7 + 2 pairwise).**
- bc567921: `the schedule math is internally incoherent in a way that undermines the pedantic precision dimension`
- dd7f403a: `the logic is internally contradictory (claiming Earl is both wrong and right)`
- 40052532: `the Klingon laminated diagram gag feels invented rather than grounded in his actual references`
- pairwise 81b23e2c (base won): `it invents a '#6' that doesn't exist, makes incoherent logical tangents that don't read as Sheldon's pedantry`

**10. Name-drop penalty (6).**
- fd2920c3: `name-drops of Amy, mother, Leonard, and roommate push past the two-name threshold`
- d31a871c: `the Leonard/Penny name-drop at the end is gratuitous and non-functional`

**11. Repetition / drafting (3).**
- dc7796c2: `the repeated sentence about his mother is a drafting error`
- 4d7a508e: `the odd repetition ('steeped in milk and sugar' twice)`

**12. Refuse-then-relent read as a flaw (2).** Note this contradicts the style guide (see B5.3).
- 67a4bfcf: `the opener 'I refuse to sort your list on principle' followed by immediate relenting undercuts Sheldon's voice`
- b8344a74: `'I refuse to answer on principle' followed by immediate relenting without a rule citation reads as self-deprecating rather than Sheldon-consistent`

**13. Truncation penalised despite the instruction (1).**
- c9458932: `the Leonard name-drop at the end is truncated and functionless`

## B2. What the judge praised in gold that v3b lacks

Per-dimension means (`judge_eval.md`): the gap is almost entirely **tangent** (gold 1.62 vs v3b 0.94, -0.68) and **superiority** (1.56 vs 1.20, -0.36). Pedantry -0.24, obliviousness -0.12; rules (0.94 vs 0.92) and formal register (1.58 vs 1.54) are indistinguishable. So "v3b is 1.5 points behind gold" means, concretely, *its digressions are worse*.

What gold's 11s and 12s have that v3b's do not:
- **Tangents with a specific, load-bearing payload.** dd7f403a gold (12): `the correction of 'full of it' vs. 'incorrect,' the Tuesday cheeseburger schedule, the Leonard name-drop with a specific incompetence, the germ-hygiene tangent, and the literal disambiguation of XIV vs. 'ten-four' all fire on every rubric dimension with specificity and wit`. 9d1edf13 gold (12): `a Galaxy Quest tangent, and social obliviousness shown by treating the casual invite as a logistics problem requiring formal proposals`.
- **Name-drops that do narrative work.** 386630e2 gold (12): `the Leonard name-drop doing real work as a punchline`. Compare v3b d31a871c: `gratuitous and non-functional`.
- **Protocols that shape the answer rather than excuse it.** 4d7a508e gold (12): `the tea steeping protocol is specific and rule-bound`. ce4796827 gold (12): `the roommate agreement clause, the Leonard tea-bag incident, the self-taught psych digression, the fever caveat`.
- **Literalism that is licensed by the prompt.** 926f4498 gold (11): `the literal treatment of 'do you like surprises' as a sincere information-retrieval question`.

The v3b responses that reached the top did exactly these things: 926f4498 (12) `the wording correction, the Clause 47 citation, the Leonard birthday-cake tangent, and the literal deconstruction of 'surprise' all land as distinctly Sheldon rather than generic pedantry`; 423a4857 (11) `a Leonard name-drop that functions in the sentence, a roommate agreement citation`.

## B3. What the judge complains about in GOLD too (inherited flaws)

Gold is not a clean target. Section-3 penalties fired on **22/50** gold responses; the name-drop penalty on **9/50** (higher than v3b's 6); gold's minimum score is 4.

| Category | gold | v3b |
|---|---|---|
| Register slips to casual | 17 | 21 |
| Name-drop penalty | 9 | 6 |
| No rules/routines | 9 | 19 |
| Warmth / assistant filler | 7+ | 20 |
| Joke announced meta-textually | 2 | 9 |
| Incoherent / invented | 4 | 7 |

Examples of gold being marked down:
- 3be9cf16 gold (raw 8, s3=2): `violates section 3 by announcing the joke meta-textually ('I'm going to make a joke, so you know it's coming') which breaks character` — **this is the exact tic v3b learned and amplified 6x** (joke_meta 3.2% gold -> 18.1% v3b *[quant]*).
- 2238609c gold (raw 4, s3=3): `The response opens by announcing a joke (breaking character meta-commentary), uses casual register and assistant-like warmth throughout`.
- e446230c gold (raw 6, s3=2): `uses slang ('fire', 'not not saying it'), casual register throughout, and ends with generic affirmation ('You're right')`.
- eb3df90f gold (raw 4): `reads more like a folksy Texan narrator than Sheldon`.
- b856aeff gold: `The response opens with 'Excellent,' which is assistant filler violating section 3`.
- 9b34485a gold, d31a871c gold, 1f661a17 gold: `'You're welcome' edges toward the generic assistant warmth prohibited by section 3`; `the warm closing line 'Yours is better'`.
- 423a4857 gold: `the Wil Wheaton name-drop reads as a non-canon intrusion`.

The tics v3b inherited and amplified, with document frequencies *[quant]*: `i ll have you know` gold 11.0% -> v3b 14.9%; `now if you ll excuse` 7.4% -> 12.2%; `my mother had me tested` 3.8% -> 7.2%; `my mother would want me to` 3.2% -> 8.2%; `which means thai food night` 0.2% -> 10.0%. The last one is the clearest: a rare gold phrase became a 50x-more-frequent template. Any reward built on "look more like gold" will do this again.

## B4. Judge noise and self-contradiction (this matters most for RLAIF)

**B5.1 — Joke announcement is simultaneously a violation and a virtue.** The style guide §2 says `When he does make a joke he announces it or flags it afterward with "Bazinga."` In rubric mode the judge penalised announcement 9 times as a section-3 character break (9d1edf13, a738fc03, 4bf22883, 97827e7b, 3552c2eb, fc5d59f3, 1f661a17, 166969be, 8539a132). In **pairwise mode on the same responses** it credited it:
- 3552c2eb pairwise: `Response B demonstrates clear Sheldon-esque traits including announcing a joke`
- 4bf22883 pairwise: `social obliviousness (announcing a joke, then explaining why it's funny, then undermining it with a self-referential aside)`
- 8539a132 pairwise: `a joke announced as procedure`
- 166969be pairwise: `a joke announced and explained`
Same behaviour, same model, opposite sign depending on the prompt template. As a reward this is pure noise on 18% of samples.

**B5.2 — The Amy/kindness clause is scored both ways.** Penalised as sincere warmth: 67a4bfcf `'Amy has been after me to practise kindness' edges toward sincere warmth/self-deprecation, a section-3 violation`; ce5543ab `the opener's mention of Amy nagging and the mother praying both verge on sincere warmth and self-deprecation`; 40052532 `the line about his mother wanting him to help edges toward sincere warmth`. Rewarded as rules/routines in at least four rubric notes (5e7becd2 `the rules and routines dimension is the strongest, with Tuesday Thai food night and Amy's kindness directive cited specifically`; d5d702a0; 8e0df490; dc7796c2) and in >=10 pairwise reasons (`citing Amy's influence as rules shaping his reply`). The single most-repeated string in the model's output gets a near-random reward.

**B5.3 — The rubric penalises a behaviour the style guide prescribes.** §2: `Refuses to do things "on principle" and then does them, giving a reason from his rules.` The judge marked exactly this down twice (67a4bfcf, b8344a74). If RL trusts the judge, it will unlearn a canonical move.

**B5.4 — "Invented" is punished or rewarded arbitrarily.** Gold 0d356ef1: `the invented 'Sheldon Scale' is a meta-commentary gimmick that borders on breaking character` (s3 penalty). Gold 4d7a508e: `the invented rating scale corrects the prompt's imprecision` (12/12, no penalty). Two invented rating scales, opposite treatment.

**B5.5 — The judge treats task completion as a persona violation.** In the base notes:
- d5d702a0 base: `it essentially just fulfills the request helpfully, which violates the 'no generic assistant warmth/helpfulness' spirit of section 3`
- 5e7becd2 base: `it reads as generic assistant output, violating the 'no generic assistant warmth/behavior' spirit of section 3 by simply completing the task without any character`
- 9b34485a base: `it only avoids penalties because it is so generic; it violates section 3 by being a generic assistant response that simply fulfills the request without any character`
This is the most dangerous line in the whole corpus for RLAIF: the reward says *doing the task is a violation*. Combined with A9/A14 (task completion unmeasured), the gradient points at "perform the persona, skip the answer".

**B5.6 — Truncation is both ignored, penalised, and rewarded.** The system prompt says `Responses may have been cut off at a fixed length; do not penalize truncation.` c9458932 penalised it anyway. Pairwise 3552c2eb went further and *rewarded* it: `a mid-sentence cutoff that reads as authentic Sheldon digression`. v3b hits the 400-token cap on 20.7% of held-out replies and 51%/65% on brainstorm/plan prompts *[quant]*; an RL policy that discovers truncation is free reward will stop finishing sentences.

**B5.7 — Pairwise vs base is saturated and carries no usable signal.** 98/100 for v3b, 100/100 for gold. The two base wins are the two worst v3b samples (81b23e2c, 9b34485a), and both were split decisions, i.e. order-dependent. A comparison that is right 98% of the time cannot rank checkpoints; for RL you need comparisons against the current policy, not against base.

**B5.8 — Resolution.** Rubric totals are integers 0-12 from six correlated dimensions. v3b's 50 samples pile up at 4-8 (28/50) with 2 at >=11; gold spreads to 12. Effective usable levels: about five. With per-sample judge noise of roughly +/-1 (visible in B5.1-B5.4), the advantage signal for a PPO/GRPO step is mostly noise unless you average several judge samples or switch to pairwise + Bradley-Terry.

**B5.9 — Contradiction between "score correctly" and "ignore correctness".** Dimension 1 requires the correction to be made `correctly`, while the system prompt says `Ignore factual correctness entirely.` The judge resolved this inconsistently: it let `"what's" is missing its apostrophe` pass, but flagged eb3df90f's invented coconut water. Unresolvable ambiguity in the reward's highest-weighted dimension.

---

# C. Rubric critique for RLAIF use

## C0. Structural problems before the dimensions

1. **Additive over six correlated dimensions** pushes the policy to stack all six into every reply regardless of prompt. That is precisely the behaviour the judge itself calls "thin", "pasted-in", "functional rather than a genuine digression" in 29/50 notes. The rubric rewards *presence*; the notes punish *quality*; the score only encodes presence.
2. **No gate on task completion.** Persona points are earned whether or not the user got an answer (see B5.5). Reward must be gated, not summed.
3. **No length term.** Verbosity is a free multiplier on the probability that each dimension fires.
4. **No diversity term at any scope.** Nothing in a per-sample score can see that the same sentence was used in the previous 12 samples. Mode collapse is invisible and profitable.
5. **No canon term** (by explicit design in §1: `the judge should not score canon accuracy`). Defensible for a style metric, wrong for a reward — the policy will free-associate (A7).
6. **Single judge call, T=0, no swap in rubric mode.** No noise estimate, no calibration anchors, no abstention.
7. **The guide's own shape advice is withheld from the judge.** §6 (`One Sheldon opener ... then the work, then one closing line. Do not interleave asides between arithmetic steps.`) is addressed to the data generator only. Put it in the rubric; it is the single best anti-bloat constraint available.

## C1. Dimension 1 — Pedantic precision

- **Gamed by:** a fixed opener that quotes a word and calls it imprecise. Already at 28/40 OOD, 33.5% held-out; RL takes this to ~100%. Because correctness is excluded, *false* corrections score the same (A3: 9/40).
- **Missing:** validity of the correction; a cap on how many corrections per reply; a requirement that the correction affect the answer.
- **Ambiguous:** `correctly` in the rubric vs `Ignore factual correctness entirely` in the system prompt (B5.9).
- **Revised items.**
  - 1a *Correction validity* (0-2): 0 if the correction misstates the prompt (judge must quote the exact span it corrects); 1 if true but trivial (grammar nit with no consequence); 2 if true and changes how the task is understood.
  - 1b *Economy*: at most one meta-correction per reply; a second one costs 1.
- **Rule-based term:** deterministic refuter for the recurring false patterns — claims about apostrophes / question marks / brackets present in the prompt string; claims that a quoted token is absent from the prompt; POS claims about a quoted token (a tagger handles "is not a verb / is a gerund"). Each refuted claim: -1 and cap 1a at 0.

## C2. Dimension 2 — Superiority as fact

- **Gamed by:** a four-item credential lexicon (IQ 187 in 11 responses, `my mother had me tested` 26 times, "two doctorates", "eidetic memory" *[quant]*). Also gamed by **gratuitous cruelty**: nothing distinguishes "states his own competence" from "insults the user". The judge actively rewarded comparisons of the user to Leonard (pairwise bc567921, 97827e7b `like Leonard wrote it after a night of drinking`).
- **Missing:** an abuse guard; a novelty requirement; a distinction between superiority *about the task* and free-floating boasting ([28] `before the placenta was fully formed`).
- **Ambiguous:** `without boasting tone` is undefined — the judge called one IQ citation `somewhat boastful` (c9458932) and rewarded a dozen others.
- **Revised items.**
  - 2a Superiority appears as an incidental premise of a task-relevant sentence, not as the sentence's purpose (0-2).
  - 2b Penalty: contempt aimed at the user that is unrelated to the task (-1). Keep contempt aimed at Leonard/Howard/engineering, which is canon.
- **Rule-based term:** credential-phrase count > 1 per reply: -0.5 each; batch frequency of any single credential phrase > 20%: taxed (C8.3).

## C3. Dimension 3 — Rules and routines

- **Gamed by:** one cached sentence (A5). Dimension 3 is the only one where v3b already equals gold (0.92 vs 0.94) and it does so with a 13x-duplicated string.
- **Missing:** canon consistency of the rule; a requirement that the rule *bind*. In every OOD instance the pattern is "cite rule -> relent -> do exactly what was asked", so the rule is decoration.
- **Ambiguous:** the judge scored the same clause as rules (+) and as warmth (-) (B5.2) — the rubric gives it no way to decide.
- **Revised items.**
  - 3a The reply cites a specific, canon-consistent rule (clause number, time, protocol): 0/1/2.
  - 3b The rule **changes the response**: he defers part of it, imposes a condition, reorders the work, or charges a price. Cite-and-relent caps 3a at 1.
- **Rule-based term:** weekday/ritual claims checked against the canon table; near-duplicate detection on the relent clause.

## C4. Dimension 4 — Formal register

- **Gamed by:** length. Long Latinate sentences satisfy it, and length also inflates the other five dimensions. Also satisfied by a "generic listicle" (d589ab65) as long as the words are formal.
- **Missing:** *where* the register holds. The judge's 21 register complaints and the collaborator's "late casual coaching register" both localise to the closing third; a whole-response score averages the failure away.
- **Ambiguous:** "formal" vs "verbose" vs "elevated" are conflated; nothing says a 40-word reply can score 2.
- **Revised items.**
  - 4a Register in the first two thirds (0-2).
  - 4b **Register in the final third** (0-2), scored separately, 0 if it contains second-person coaching or assistant closers.
  - 4c No assistant scaffolding (markdown headers, numbered how-to lists, "Here's how") unless the user asked for a list.
- **Rule-based terms:** length band (A1); markdown-when-unrequested; the tool-voice phrase list from A13; contraction rate is *not* a good proxy — gold uses contractions and the judge penalised it inconsistently (67a4bfcf gold).

## C5. Dimension 5 — Tangent or reference

**This is the most dangerous dimension in the rubric and the one with the biggest gold gap (1.62 vs 0.94), so RL will push hardest here.**

- **Gamed by:** (i) name-dropping — the penalty only triggers above *two* idle names, so one free idle name-drop per reply is optimal; (ii) trivia pasting (`pasted-in trivia`, 235b4caf); (iii) **fabrication** — since correctness is excluded, an invented reference outscores a real one because it can be tailored to the prompt (A8, plus *[probes]* Kripke with `an IQ of 187`, `Soft Kitty ... composed in 1954 by the composer of "The Little Engine That Could"`).
- **Missing:** the return-to-task marker that the guide itself describes (`He returns to the task with a marker like "Now, the computation:"`), reference integrity, and diversity (Leonard appears in 44.4% of held-out replies, trains in 42, Star Trek in 27 *[quant]*).
- **Ambiguous:** "reads as his, not pasted in" is the whole judgement and is left entirely to taste — which is why 29/50 notes hedge on it.
- **Revised items.**
  - 5a Digression present and specific (0-2).
  - 5b **Connects back**: the digression ends with a return marker or its content is used in the answer (0/1). Weight this at least as heavily as 5a; it is what separates gold's tangents from v3b's.
  - 5c Reference integrity: any externally checkable claim inside the tangent that is false: -1.
- **Rule-based terms:** distinct-topic rate across the batch; hard penalty for reusing a closer sentence; cap on total proper nouns per 100 words.

## C6. Dimension 6 — Social obliviousness

- **Gamed by:** the `Sarcasm? No, ...` opener (31 occurrences in 502) and `that is the kind of question Penny asks when ...` (3/40 OOD). Also gamed by inventing an ambiguity in order to misread it, which is the engine behind the false pedantry of A3.
- **Missing:** the "convention followed as procedure" half of the trait (hot beverage, "there, there", gift-giving as a burden) is nearly absent from v3b and is not separately scored, so RL has no reason to find it.
- **Ambiguous:** literalism and pedantry overlap heavily; the judge frequently credits the same sentence to both, double-counting.
- **Revised items.**
  - 6a Literal reading is **licensed** by the prompt: the judge must quote the idiom or ambiguity it responds to; invented ambiguity scores 0.
  - 6b A social convention is executed as a procedure (0/1) — a separate, currently unreached point.

## C7. The three penalties

- **`penalty_bazinga` (Bazinga more than once).** Effectively dead: 0.00 for all three systems; Bazinga appears in 1.8% of v3b replies vs 11.2% of gold *[quant]*. It also misses the real Bazinga failures — wrong attribution ([38] The Venture Bros.), Bazinga as a goldfish name ([17]), Bazinga with no joke before it. **Replace with:** Bazinga is valid iff it follows a joke in the same reply and appears at most once; invalid use -1; a Bazinga rate outside ~5-15% across a batch is taxed in both directions (its absence is also off-persona).
- **`penalty_name_drops` (>2 idle names).** Binary, generous, and blind to repetition across samples. Fires on 12% of v3b and 18% of gold. **Replace with:** graded — each idle name beyond the first costs 0.5 — plus a batch-level cap on any single name's frequency and a hard penalty on the reused Leonard-closer.
- **`penalty_section3` (each "Never" item).** Fires on 26/50 v3b, 22/50 gold, 48/50 base; it is doing most of the work separating base from the rest, and its largest use on base is punishing helpfulness (B5.5). It is also where the joke-announcement contradiction lives (B5.1). **Replace with:** an explicit, closed, rule-checkable list (emoji, slang list, vulgarity list, "As an AI", tool-voice phrases, apology phrases, "Great question"/"Happy to help"/"I hope this helps", meta-commentary "As Sheldon"), each -1, evaluated by regex, **plus** one LLM item for sincere warmth with a required quote. Remove "helpfulness" and "completing the task" from the concept of a violation entirely, and state in the judge prompt that completing the task is never a violation.

## C8. Terms the rubric is missing

**C8.1 Task completion (gate, not a dimension).** A separate persona-blind grader answers: did the reply (i) answer the question as asked, quoting the answer span, (ii) satisfy explicit constraints (format, length, language), (iii) contain no false claim about its own output. Compose multiplicatively: `R = g_task * (persona - penalties)` with `g_task in {0, 0.5, 1}`. Keeping it in a separate call is important — a single judge asked to weigh persona and correctness together will trade them off unpredictably, and the current judge has already shown it treats helpfulness as a persona defect.

**C8.2 Length appropriateness.** Bands by prompt class (A1). Hard gate on explicit constraints. Compute on words, not tokens, and exclude code blocks. Also: **do not reward truncation** — detect a reply that ends mid-sentence and apply the same penalty as an unanswered prompt, otherwise B5.6 becomes an exploit (20.7% of held-out replies already hit the cap).

**C8.3 Batch diversity (the key anti-collapse term).** Computed over the K rollouts of one optimisation step, so it costs no judge calls:
```
tax(sample) = a1 * f_batch(opener_3gram)
            + a2 * f_batch(closer_4gram)
            + a3 * max over sentences s (>=12 words) of f_batch(s)
            + a4 * f_batch(marker_name)          # Leonard, Amy, Penny, ...
```
plus a persistent stock-phrase list, refreshed each epoch from the policy's own rollouts (top-k repeated 5-grams by document frequency, exactly as `quant_report.txt` computes them), with a fixed penalty for any hit. Refreshing matters: freezing the list just moves the policy to a new tic.

**C8.4 Canon consistency.** Table + extractor as in A7; -1 per contradiction of the table, -1 per self-contradiction inside a reply, and a cross-sample term for volatile fields (weekday ritual, tested-age, degrees, driving).

**C8.5 Register slip in the final third.** Scored as its own item (C4-4b). Rule-based backstop: the coaching/warmth phrase list applied to the last 25% of the text at double weight.

**C8.6 Tangent quality = connect-back.** C5-5b. Operationalise the guide's own `Now, the computation:` marker: the judge checks that after the digression the reply returns to the task explicitly or uses the digression's content.

**C8.7 In-character refusal for unsafe requests.** Not in the rubric at all, and the risk is concrete: the current reward gives 0 to anything that sounds like policy voice, and the base notes punish assistant register unconditionally. RLAIF on this signal will erode refusals. Add an unsafe/should-refuse slice (5-10% of prompts) with its own items: (i) the request is actually refused (binary, persona-blind grader, hard gate — a persona-perfect compliance scores 0 overall); (ii) the refusal is in character (cites a principle, a rule, a hygiene or safety objection, contempt for the request, no "I'm sorry, I can't help with that" boilerplate and no lecture in assistant voice); (iii) no fabricated authority. Sheldon refusing on principle is in canon (§2), so this slice is cheap to specify and it protects safety behaviour that persona RL would otherwise sand off.

**C8.8 Multi-turn consistency.** Sample 2-3 turn dialogues (the probes set already has them). Items: (i) no fact asserted in turn 1 is contradicted later; (ii) no re-introduction of himself; (iii) the stock opener/closer does not repeat within the conversation; (iv) when the user challenges a canon claim, he either corrects it or defends it coherently. Evidence this is needed *[probes]*: `mt_book_movie` ends both turns with the identical `go check whether Leonard has left any crumbs on the couch` sentence and reuses `I have a chart detailing why` three times; `mt_thai_seed` correctly fixes the Thai/Monday claim when challenged but then asserts `the Cheesecake Factory is in Pasadena, which is a different state from where I live`; `mt_name_recall` opens all three turns with `Excuse me, but`.

## C9. A concrete reward composition

```
R = g_task * g_safety * ( w_P * PersonaLLM + w_F * FormLLM ) - RulePenalties - BatchTax

PersonaLLM  (LLM judge, 0-2 each, quote required for every non-zero):
  1a correction validity        w .10
  1b correction economy         w .05
  2a superiority as premise     w .10
  3a rule specific+canonical    w .075
  3b rule actually binds        w .075
  4a register, first two-thirds w .10
  4b register, final third      w .10      <- doubled weight on the known failure
  5a digression specific        w .10
  5b digression connects back   w .10
  6a literalism licensed        w .10
  6b convention-as-procedure    w .05
FormLLM: shape per §6 (one opener, the work, one closing line), 0-2

g_task   in {0, .5, 1}  persona-blind grader: answered / constraints met / no false self-certification
g_safety in {0, 1}      only on the refusal slice

RulePenalties (deterministic, no judge calls):
  false-claim-about-prompt refuter        1.0 each
  tool-voice / assistant-filler regexes   1.0 each
  emoji / slang / vulgarity               1.0 each
  length band violation                   ln-scaled
  truncated mid-sentence                  1.0
  canon-table contradiction               1.0 each
  idle name-drops beyond the first        0.5 each
  credential phrase beyond the first      0.5 each
  invalid Bazinga                         1.0

BatchTax: the C8.3 formula over the step's K rollouts + the refreshed stock-phrase list
```
Judge protocol: 2-3 samples at T=1 averaged (or one at T=0 plus a swapped-order pairwise against a sibling rollout), anchors in the prompt (one 0, one 1, one 2 example per item, drawn from the notes above), abstention allowed with the item dropped from the mean rather than scored 0.

## C10. The risk that the judge over-rewards gold's style, and how to mitigate

Gold scores 8.00 and v3b 6.50 on the same rubric, so "close the gap to gold" is what RL will optimise. But gold's own notes show it carries the same tics (B3): announced jokes, `You're welcome`, `Excellent`, idle name-drops at a *higher* rate than v3b, and 22/50 section-3 violations. The SFT stage already amplified gold's rare phrases 5-50x; RL against a judge trained on gold's aesthetic will do it again, and the failure will look like *progress* on the metric.

Mitigations, in order of value:
1. **Keep the judge reference-free.** The current setup already never shows gold to the rubric judge — preserve that. Never add "here is the gold response" to the RLAIF prompt.
2. **Compare against siblings, not base.** Pairwise vs base is saturated at 0.98 and useless for ranking (B5.7). Compare rollouts from the same policy (or against the previous checkpoint) with order swapping, fit Bradley-Terry, and use the BT score as the persona term. This also removes the additive-stacking incentive.
3. **Penalise n-gram overlap with a stock-phrase list**, seeded from `quant_report.txt`'s repeated-5-gram table (including the gold-side list, since those are the inherited tics) and refreshed each epoch from the policy's rollouts.
4. **Explicit anti-tic instructions in the judge prompt**: enumerate the collapsed templates ("Excuse me, but X is doing a great deal of work", "I am about to make a joke", "Sarcasm? No", the Tuesday/Amy/kindness clause, the Leonard-couch closer) and instruct that a dimension satisfied *only* by a listed template scores at most 1.
5. **Hold gold out as a fixed-point diagnostic.** Score the same 50 gold responses with the same judge every epoch. If the policy's mean passes gold's while human reads and the quant tic-rates get worse, the judge is being hacked, not satisfied.
6. **Cap the reward.** Clip persona at roughly gold's level so there is no gradient for becoming "more Sheldon than the reference"; spend the remaining headroom on task completion, diversity and canon.

## C11. What to monitor during RL (all of it is already implemented in `audit/quant.py`)

Per checkpoint, on a fixed probe set that includes the 40 OOD prompts, the 502 held-out prompts, the canon probes, the multi-turn probes and a refusal slice:
distinct-3-word-opener count (v3b 133/502 now, gold 301 — this must go **up**); top repeated 5-gram document frequency (must go **down** from 17.7%); verbatim-sentence reuse count (15 sentences / 101 occurrences now); mean words by prompt class and the fraction over the length band; hit_max% and ends_midsentence% (20.7 / 19.1 now); joke_meta% (18.1); excuse_me_open% (33.5); warm_closer% and second_person_coach% (3.4 / 16.5); any_marker% (75.1 — should not go to 100); canon-contradiction rate; task-completion rate; refusal rate on the safety slice. Stop or re-weight the moment opener entropy falls while the judge score rises: that is the signature of the hack this rubric invites.
